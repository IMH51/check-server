#Check - Poker odds calculator
------------------------------

Check is a Rails API and React based app that was build as a Mod 4 Project at Flatiron School London.
This is the backend Rails API repository, the React fronted is hosted by [NathanB09](https://github.com/NathanB09) and can be found [here.](https://github.com/NathanB09/Check)

Users of this app can create a query based on an in-game poker scenario and find out their out odds of winning, losing or splitting the hand at that exact point in the hand.
The odds are fetched from an external API, details of which can be seen [here.](https://rapidapi.com/danielamitay/api/poker-odds) Users can also see the last 5 queries they have made, enabling them to see their progress over the course of hand at various points.
